# MMNet Training Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to address the training issues identified in the initial results.

## Issues Identified
- Severe class imbalance (70.7% malignant vs 29.3% benign)
- Overfitting patterns with high train/validation loss gaps
- Inconsistent performance across folds (BalAcc: 0.600-0.858)
- Suboptimal threshold selection
- High cross-fold variance

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Focal Loss (High Priority ✅)
- **Gamma**: Increased from 2.0 → 3.0 for better focus on hard examples
- **Alpha**: Adjusted from 0.7 → 0.25 for better class imbalance handling
- **Label Smoothing**: Increased from 0.2 → 0.3 to prevent overconfidence
- **Enhanced Implementation**: Added binary classification support with BCE loss

### 2. Strengthened Regularization (High Priority ✅)
- **Dropout Rate**: Increased from 0.7 → 0.8 for stronger overfitting prevention
- **Weight Decay**: Increased from 5e-3 → 1e-2 for final layers
- **Mixup Alpha**: Increased from 0.2 → 0.4 for stronger augmentation
- **Gradient Clipping**: Reduced max norm from 1.0 → 0.5 for stability

### 3. Improved Validation Strategy (Medium Priority ✅)
- **Validation Split**: Reduced from 30% → 20% for better training data utilization
- **Early Stopping**: Reduced patience from 7 → 5 epochs for faster overfitting detection
- **Threshold Optimization**: Switched from F1-maximization to Youden's J statistic

### 4. Enhanced Data Sampling (Medium Priority ✅)
- **Class-Balanced Sampling**: Added WeightedRandomSampler for imbalanced datasets
- **Stratified Validation**: Ensures balanced benign/malignant splits
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Comprehensive sampling metrics with class distribution tracking

### 5. Overfitting Detection (High Priority ✅)
- **Train/Validation Gap Monitoring**: Automatic detection when gap exceeds 15%
- **Stronger Regularization**: Multiple layers of dropout and augmentation
- **Validation Dropout**: Maintained for better generalization

### 6. Ensemble Methods (Medium Priority ✅)
- **Cross-Fold Ensemble**: Use top-3 performing folds for final model
- **Test-Time Augmentation**: 5-fold augmentation during inference
- **Snapshot Ensemble**: Save checkpoints at different training stages
- **Weighted Averaging**: Use validation performance as ensemble weights

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration
- `config.py`: Updated focal loss parameters, regularization settings, and threshold optimization

### Training Pipeline
- `training/train_mm_k_fold.py`: Enhanced training loop with better regularization and threshold selection
- `training/ensemble_utils.py`: New ensemble implementation with cross-fold and test-time augmentation

### Data Pipeline
- `preprocess/multimagset.py`: Added class-balanced sampling and enhanced statistics
- `preprocess/kfold_splitter.py`: Improved stratified sampling with reduced validation split

## Expected Improvements

### Performance Metrics
- **Reduced Cross-Fold Variance**: Expected 50% reduction in standard deviation
- **Better Class Balance**: Improved handling of minority class (benign)
- **Faster Convergence**: Reduced training time with better early stopping
- **Enhanced Generalization**: Better test performance with reduced overfitting

### Training Stability
- **Consistent Thresholds**: More stable threshold selection across folds
- **Balanced Metrics**: Improved balanced accuracy and F1 scores
- **Robust Evaluation**: Better handling of imbalanced test sets

## Usage Instructions

### Running Improved Training
```bash
# Standard training with all improvements
python main.py

# Training with ensemble evaluation
python main.py --use_ensemble
```

### Monitoring Improvements
- Check new training logs for enhanced metrics
- Monitor class distribution in sampling statistics
- Verify threshold stability across folds

## Next Steps
1. Run training with new parameters
2. Compare results using new ensemble utilities
3. Fine-tune regularization if still overfitting
4. Consider additional augmentation strategies if needed
